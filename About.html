        <p style="font-family: Cherry cream Soda, cursive"></p>

        <p>  Prior to my coding journey, I was a 911 dispatcher, a paramedic, a culinary school dropout, and most recently a Hebrew teacher. </p>

<p> When I'm not learning how to code, I live to travel, especially road trips. I have been to 47 states and have traveled across the country 3 times so far. I also leave the country occassionally but I prefer the open road to the sky if I'm not the one doing the flying. </p>
<p>
In addition to oldies, traveling, feeling most at peace living in a place with mountains, I also love to sew, knit, and improve my wanting art skills through classes and lots of practice. My goal is to be a full stack developer but I also want to have some knowledge and experience with UI/UX and web design to bridge my creative side with my technical side. </p>
